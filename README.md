This seminar report focuses on studying the paper "A Bayesian Clustering Validity Index." The goal is to analyze clustering validity indices based on two main methods: K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means. The report will evaluate these two algorithms using both hard clustering (for K-Means) and soft clustering (for Fuzzy C-Means) validity indices.
